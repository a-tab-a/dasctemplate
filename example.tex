\section*{Abstract}

It is not necessary that this abstract be the same as the abstract you previously submitted. This abstract should be a synopsis of your paper. It will generally not be longer than the first column of your paper.

\section*{Do This First!}

Before you do anything else, please print a copy of this file! It contains instructions for producing your paper for the 34th DASC. This file is also a template for creating your paper; you can delete or type over these instructions to help you get started. Finally, the printed version of these instructions will serve as a visual reference of how your finished paper should look.

\section*{Title}

The title of your paper should not exceed 80 characters in length, including spaces. If your title exceeds the 80 character limit, the title will be truncated in signage at the Conference.


\section*{Other Things You Need to Know About Formatting Your Paper}

\section*{Submitting Your Final Paper for Review and Approval}

As soon as you have completed the final version of your paper, submit it electronically at: \url{www.dasconline.org}. This must be done no later than August 13, 2015 to ensure adequate time for review and publication.
If you opted for a peer-review of your paper, a draft should be provided to your session chair by June 1, 2015.
Name the file using your abstract number and up to the first five (5) letters of your last name (i.e., for abstract number 115, author Michael L. Johnson would save his file as: 115johns.pdf.) Omit any spaces in your last name when naming your file (i.e., for abstract number 122, author Tom de Jong would save his file as: 122dejon.pdf).
If you cannot submit the paper via \url{www.dasconline.org}, or your paper is more than 25MB, two additional options are available:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Email (if less than 15 MB in size); or
	\item Send a CD, or DVD by postal service to the Publications Editor at the address below, under heading “Additional Documentation Requirements” 
\end{itemize}

The point of this conference is to foster a healthy information exchange among government and industry representatives.  If you upload a paper for publication, then at least one of the authors listed on the paper is expected to attend and present that paper.  IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.  Please register for the conference at \url{www.dasconline.org}.
